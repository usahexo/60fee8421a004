        <h1 id="How-did-Fabet-arrive-in-the-NFL"><a href="#How-did-Fabet-arrive-in-the-NFL" class="headerlink" title="How did Fabet arrive in the NFL?"></a>How did Fabet arrive in the NFL?</h1><p>Fabet Akinyemi was born in Lagos, Nigeria on November 10, 1995. As a youngster, Fabet was always active and loved sports.</p>
<p>In high school, Fabet starred on the football field as a wide receiver and defensive back. His athleticism and natural talent garnered the interest of many NCAA Division I programs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Fabet chose to attend Southern Illinois University Carbondale where he continued his successful football career. In his three years at SIU Carbondale, Fabet caught 132 passes for 1,879 yards and 16 touchdowns. He was also named a First Team All-American in 2017.</p>
<p>The NFL took notice of Fabet’s impressive play, and he was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the fifth round of the 2018 NFL Draft. He has since emerged as one of the league’s most promising young players.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-Fabet’s-stats-for-the-Houston-Texans"><a href="#What-are-Fabet’s-stats-for-the-Houston-Texans" class="headerlink" title="What are Fabet’s stats for the Houston Texans?"></a>What are Fabet’s stats for the Houston Texans?</h1><p>The Houston Texans drafted Fabet with the 27th pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. </p>
<p>Height: 5’10”<br>Weight: 192 lbs<br>Arm Length: 31 ¾”<br>Hand Size: 9”<br>40 Yard Dash: 4.48<br>Bench Press: 18 reps<br>Vertical Jump: 38”<br>Broad Jump: 10’2”<br>3 Cone Drill: 6.72<br>20 Yard Shuttle: 4.06</p>
<h1 id="How-does-Fabet-feel-about-his-performance-with-the-Texans"><a href="#How-does-Fabet-feel-about-his-performance-with-the-Texans" class="headerlink" title="How does Fabet feel about his performance with the Texans?"></a>How does Fabet feel about his performance with the Texans?</h1><p>Fabet said he is happy with the way things have gone so far with the Texans. “I think we’ve done a good job. I’m happy with where we are.”</p>
<p>Houston Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler said Thursday he believes backup Tom Savage has a future in the NFL, despite taking just one snap all season.</p>
<p>“Tom is a Stud,” Osweiler replied when asked about Savage’s future. “He’s going to be a great player in this league for a long time.”</p>
<p>Savage completed 22 of 32 passes for 260 yards and two touchdowns in the preseason. He entered camp as the team’s backup to Osweiler after Brian Hoyer was released in March. Savage played one snap this season when Osweiler left the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with an injury.</p>
<p>Houston Texans backup quarterback Tom Savage has completed 22 of 32 passes for 260 yards and two touchdowns in preseason play, earning high praise from starting quarterback Brock Osweiler Thursday.<br>“Tom is a Stud,” Osweiler replied when asked about Savage’s future. “He’s going to be a great player in this league for a long time.” </p>
<h1 id="Who-are-some-of-Fabet’s-biggest-fans"><a href="#Who-are-some-of-Fabet’s-biggest-fans" class="headerlink" title="Who are some of Fabet’s biggest fans?"></a>Who are some of Fabet’s biggest fans?</h1><p>There are many famous athletes who have praised Fabet for his work. NBA superstar LeBron James is one of them. “There are a lot of different camps doing things with basketball,” said James. “Fabet is one of the top guys in the world.”</p>
<p>James is not the only high-profile fan of Fabet’s work. Soccer superstar Lionel Messi has also sung his praises, saying “Fabet understands basketball more than anyone I know.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s in the NBA or in international soccer, Fabet has won over some of the biggest names in sports with his unique approach to training and coaching.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-Fabet-hope-to-achieve-with-the-Texans"><a href="#What-does-Fabet-hope-to-achieve-with-the-Texans" class="headerlink" title="What does Fabet hope to achieve with the Texans?"></a>What does Fabet hope to achieve with the Texans?</h1><p>In his first season as head coach of the Houston Texans, Bill O’Brien has led the team to a respectable 7-6 record. But with the playoffs out of reach, many are wondering what O’Brien’s long-term goals are for the Texans.</p>
<p>O’Brien has already made some big changes in Houston, most notably replacing quarterback Matt Schaub with Ryan Fitzpatrick. And it seems that Fabet is not content with just making the Texans competitive; he wants to build a Super Bowl contender.</p>
<p>The first step in this process is finding a quarterback who can lead the team to victory. Fitzpatrick has done a decent job this season, but he is not the long-term answer. The Texans will likely be looking for a new quarterback in the offseason, and Fabet is sure to have some interesting options.</p>
<p>He will also be looking to improve the team’s defense. The Texans have struggled against the pass this season, and they will need to make some changes if they want to compete in the tough AFC South division.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what Fabet does next season in Houston. He has already shown that he is not afraid to make changes, and he clearly wants to bring a championship to Houston.</p>
