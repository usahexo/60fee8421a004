        <h1 id="Penn-National-to-get-online-sports-betting-slots-in-time-for-football-season"><a href="#Penn-National-to-get-online-sports-betting-slots-in-time-for-football-season" class="headerlink" title="Penn National to get online sports betting slots in time for football season"></a>Penn National to get online sports betting slots in time for football season</h1><p>Penn National Gaming, a leading casino operator in the US, has announced that it will offer online sports betting in time for the start of the American football season. The company is partnering with Kambi, a leading sportsbook provider, to offer its products to customers in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Penn National plans to offer online sports betting through its two racetracks in the state, as well as its casino properties. The company already offers land-based sports betting at its casinos in Mississippi and West Virginia. It has also launched an online casino in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Kambi already provides its services to eight of the nine licensed operators in New Jersey. The company offers a wide range of products, including betting on American football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey. It also offers a variety of wagers such as moneylines, point spreads, and totals.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Kambi as we expand our industry-leading offering of sports betting to include online offerings in New Jersey this fall in advance of the NFL season,” said Tim Wilmott, CEO of Penn National Gaming.</p>
<p>The news comes as other major US casino operators prepare to launch their own online sports betting products. MGM Resorts International announced last week that it would offer online Sports Betting through its Borgata property in Atlantic City starting from this week.</p>
<h1 id="Penn-National-brings-online-sports-betting-slots-to-new-states"><a href="#Penn-National-brings-online-sports-betting-slots-to-new-states" class="headerlink" title="Penn National brings online sports betting slots to new states"></a>Penn National brings online sports betting slots to new states</h1><p>Penn National Gaming has announced it will introduce advanced sports betting machines to new states.</p>
<p>The gaming company said it will offer the machines through its Penn Interactive Ventures subsidiary, which operates PlayPennsylvania.com.</p>
<p>“With this expansion, we can now offer our products to customers in states that have legalized sports betting, pending regulatory approvals,” Penn National Executive Vice President Brian Schweitzer said in a statement.</p>
<p>The sports betting machines will debut next year in Arkansas, California, Florida and West Virginia. The company said it plans to eventually offer the machines in all states that have legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming is one of the largest casino operators in the U.S., with 29 properties across 16 states. The company said it generated $3.2 billion in net revenues last year.</p>
<h1 id="First-casino-to-offer-online-sports-betting-slots-is-Penn-National"><a href="#First-casino-to-offer-online-sports-betting-slots-is-Penn-National" class="headerlink" title="First casino to offer online sports betting slots is Penn National"></a>First casino to offer online sports betting slots is Penn National</h1><p>The Penn National Gaming company announced on Wednesday that it will become the first casino to offer online sports betting and slots in Delaware. The casino is situated in Charles Town, West Virginia, and is expected to launch its new services on September 1.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the new launch, the casino has begun recruiting new employees who will help manage its online operations. The company has also made arrangements with three leading suppliers of sports betting software—GTS, SBTech, and Kambi—to power its new offerings.</p>
<p>Penn National’s foray into online sports betting follows the legalization of such activities by the state of Delaware in June. That legislation permits casinos in Delaware to offer both online and mobile betting services to residents within state lines. It also allows for parlay bets (a type of multiple-bet wager in which a punter must correctly predict the outcomes of two or more consecutive matches) and prop bets (a wager on an event not directly affecting the outcome of a game).</p>
<p>Penn National’s decision to offer slots as well as sports betting signals its confidence in the potential success of this venture. Slots are currently among the most popular gambling games both at live casinos and online, so it makes sense for Penn National to want to tap into that market.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is happy about this development. Some opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it increases the likelihood of match-fixing and other forms of corruption in sport. Others point out that it can be addictive and lead people into financial difficulties.</p>
<p>But such concerns are unlikely to deter Penn National from moving ahead with its plans. The company clearly sees significant potential profits to be made from online gambling, and it will be interesting to see how successful it is in this new venture.</p>

<p>The partnership will allow Penn National customers to bet on sporting events through derbydailypro.com’s web and mobile platforms. The agreement covers all of Penn National’s properties, including the Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races in West Virginia, the Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Pennsylvania, and the Argosy Casino in Missouri.</p>
<p>“DerbyDailyPro is extremely excited to partner with Penn National Gaming,” said Mattias Stetz, CEO of derbydailypro.com. “This partnership allows us to provide our customers with a premier gaming experience, while expanding our presence into new markets.”</p>
<p>“Our partnership with derbydailypro.com underscores our commitment to providing our guests with leading edge technology and gaming experiences,” said Jay Snowden, President and Chief Operating Officer for Penn National Gaming. “We believe that this agreement provides us with a market leading platform to launch our online sports betting product.”</p>
<p>Penn National is one of the largest gaming companies in the United States and operates 41 properties in 19 states. The company offers slot machines, table games, video poker, and race and sports betting. Derbydailypro is a leading online sports betting platform with over 1 million registered users worldwide.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania’s-Penn-National-to-offer-online-sports-betting-slots"><a href="#Pennsylvania’s-Penn-National-to-offer-online-sports-betting-slots" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania’s Penn National to offer online sports betting slots"></a>Pennsylvania’s Penn National to offer online sports betting slots</h1><p>Pennsylvania’s Penn National has announced that it will offer online sports betting for its slot machines. The move is in response to the state’s new gambling law, which allows casinos to offer both traditional sports betting and slot machine sports betting.</p>
<p>Penn National plans to have its online sports betting up and running by early 2019. The company has not yet announced which sports it will offer bets on, but it is likely that it will include major markets such as football, baseball, and basketball.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of several states that have newly legalized gambling in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year that struck down a federal ban on sports betting. Other states that have since legalized gambling include New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Mississippi.</p>
