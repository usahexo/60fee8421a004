#  have a hundred bucks? here's what you should do with it in a finnish casino!

When you walk into a casino, the first thing you need to do is find the cashier and change your money into chips. In Finland, the basic chip denominations are €5, €10, €20 and €50. So unless you're feeling particularly flush, start with €5 chips.

Next, it's time to explore the casino and find a game that suits you. Table games like blackjack, roulette and craps offer the best odds but they can be complex so if you're new to gambling, stick to slots or video poker.

Most casinos have electronic versions of popular table games too, which are perfect for beginners. These games are played against the machine rather than other players so there's no need to worry about making a fool of yourself. Just make sure you read the rules carefully before playing.

Once you've found a game that interests you, it's time to place your chips on the table and start playing!
