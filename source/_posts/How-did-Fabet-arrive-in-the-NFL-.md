#  What does Fabet hope to achieve with the Texans?

In his first season as head coach of the Houston Texans, Bill O’Brien has led the team to a respectable 7-6 record. But with the playoffs out of reach, many are wondering what O’Brien’s long-term goals are for the Texans.

O’Brien has already made some big changes in Houston, most notably replacing quarterback Matt Schaub with Ryan Fitzpatrick. And it seems that Fabet is not content with just making the Texans competitive; he wants to build a Super Bowl contender.

The first step in this process is finding a quarterback who can lead the team to victory. Fitzpatrick has done a decent job this season, but he is not the long-term answer. The Texans will likely be looking for a new quarterback in the offseason, and Fabet is sure to have some interesting options.

He will also be looking to improve the team’s defense. The Texans have struggled against the pass this season, and they will need to make some changes if they want to compete in the tough AFC South division.

It will be interesting to see what Fabet does next season in Houston. He has already shown that he is not afraid to make changes, and he clearly wants to bring a championship to Houston.
