#  What is the Average Tip for a New Blackjack Dealer in Reno? 

If you're new to the blackjack table, there's a good chance you're wondering what the average tip is for a dealer in Reno. 

Dealers in Reno can expect to make around $8 an hour, including their tips. However, the amount of a tip varies depending on the player's experience and the casino's rules. 

Generally, players will give dealers a $1 or $2 tip for every $10 they bet at the table. So, if you're betting $100 per hand, you can expect to give your dealer a $10 or $20 tip at the end of your playing session. 

Some casinos also have a service charge added to each bill, which means that dealers may not get all of their tips from players. In these cases, it's customary for players to leave an extra dollar or two on the table as a show of appreciation. 

Whether or not you should tip your dealer is ultimately up to you. If you feel like they've provided good service, then tipping is always appreciated. However, if you don't feel like they did a good job, then there's no need to tip them anything. 

In general, though, tipping your dealer is one way to show your appreciation for their hard work and help make their job a little bit more lucrative.

#  How Much Tips can a New Blackjack Dealer Expect to Receive? 

When it comes to tipping, there are no hard and fast rules. What one person considers appropriate may be considered excessive by someone else. That said, there are some general guidelines that can help you determine how much to tip a new blackjack dealer.

For starters, it's generally customary to tip service staff such as bartenders, waitstaff, and dealers in casino games. The amount you should tip depends on a number of factors, including the quality of service received and how much money you've won or lost while playing.

In general, most people tend to tip between 10 and 20 percent of the total bill. So if you've won $100 playing blackjack, you might consider tipping the dealer $10-$20. If you've lost $100, then you might only want to tip them $5-$10.

Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines. You may want to adjust the amount depending on the circumstances. If the dealer goes out of their way to help you out or provides exceptional service, then feel free to tip them more than the recommended amount.

Ultimately, it's up to you how much to tip a new blackjack dealer. But following these basic guidelines will give you a good starting point.
