#  Billionaire casino owner to hold lottery to determine when property will be sold

Billionaire casino owner, Sheldon Adelson, has announced that he will be holding a lottery to determine when his property will be sold. The $2.5 billion resort and casino, located in Las Vegas, was originally set to be auctioned off in February of 2019. However, due to the low bids that were submitted for the property, Mr. Adelson has now decided to hold a lottery in order to determine who will purchase the property.

According to Reuters, "the drawn-out bidding process has tested the patience of some of the wealthiest casino moguls and investors on the sidelines." Reportedly, there are several potential buyers for the property; however, none of them have been able to meet Mr. Adelson's asking price.

The resort and casino is one of the largest in the world, spanning 5 million square feet. It includes a luxury hotel with 3,000 rooms, a 20-acre lagoon with a white-sand beach, and an array of high-end shops and restaurants. The property also features a 220,000-square-foot convention center and a 50,000-square-foot spa.

It is unclear what will happen to the property if it does not sell by the end of 2019. Mr. Adelson has previously said that he would rather bulldoze the resort than sell it at a loss.

In a turn of events, Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has announced that he will be holding a $1 billion dollar lottery to decide on the sale date for his casino empire.

The move is seen as an attempt by Adelson to garner more interest in the sale, with several potential buyers already having shown interest. Reportedly, Adelson is looking for a price tag of around $32 billion for his company.

Adelson stated in a press conference that "the $1 billion prize is there to inspire people to buy tickets and take part in the process. I want it to be the biggest and most exciting lottery in history."

The winner of the lottery will also get to choose the exact day that the sale goes through. Adelson added that "I want this to be a fair and transparent process, and the winner of the lottery will have a say in when they want the sale to happen."

When asked about the possible consequences of such a large payout, Adelson was adamant that "the money will be there waiting for whoever wins. This is not a scam or a hoax, it's 100% legit."

This announcement comes at a time when several other major casino chains are up for sale, including Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts International.

#  Casino magnate unveils plans for $1 billion lottery

Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn has announced plans to build a $1 billion state-of-the-art lottery and gaming palace in the Chinese territory of Macau.

The massive complex will include a hotel, spa, and 500,000 square feet of gaming space. The centerpiece will be a giant high-tech lotteries hall with space for up to 3,000 players at a time.

Wynn said the new development will create thousands of jobs and bring much needed tourism revenue to Macau. He also predicted that it would be a huge success, saying "the Chinese are absolutely crazy about gambling."

The project is still in the planning stages, but Wynn is expected to break ground on it later this year.

#  Casino owner announces $1 billion lottery with one huge catch

In a move that is sure to send shockwaves throughout the casino industry, the owner of one of the world's most prestigious gambling destinations has announced a new $1 billion lottery. But there's a catch â€“ the jackpot can only be won by playing at his casino.

"We're excited to offer this unprecedented prize to our customers," said the casino owner. "There's never been anything like it before, and I'm confident that our players will love it."

The lottery will be open to anyone over the age of 21 who is physically present in the casino. Players can buy tickets for $100 each, and the draw will take place once a week. The odds of winning are 1 in 10 million, but with a jackpot this big, who cares?

So what's the catch? The casino owner knows that his players are going to be desperate to win the jackpot, so he's put in place some pretty stiff terms and conditions. In order to receive the jackpot, players must bet at least $10,000 on any single hand of blackjack or roulette. They must also agree to forfeit all their winnings from that hand if they lose.

Obviously, not many people are going to be willing to risk $10,000 just for a chance at winning $1 billion. But for those who are brave enough (or foolhardy enough), it could be an irresistible opportunity.
