In a remarkable story that is still unfolding, John Hunter has managed to mastermind a football betting win that has seen him make over £1 million in profits!

The astonishing thing about Hunter’s win is that it was achieved by placing his bets at very short odds – often just 1.01 or 1.02. This means that his returns on investment have been absolutely massive, with some individual bets yielding profits of over £100,000.

Despite this, Hunter remains remarkably calm and collected about the whole thing, insisting that he always maintained a healthy respect for the risks involved in betting on football matches. “It’s not a foolproof system by any means,” he said in an interview shortly after his win was announced. “There’s always the potential for things to go wrong, but I feel like I have a good understanding of how the markets work and how to exploit them.”

One thing is for sure – if you want to make money betting on football matches, then you would do well to take note of what John Hunter is doing!

#  How John Hunter won 100k from football betting!

John Hunter is a 23-year-old guy from Liverpool who has recently won £100,000 by betting on football matches. John’s secret is that he only bets on home teams to win and he never risks more than 5% of his bankroll on any one bet.

This system has been very successful for John, who has only had two losing bets in the past 12 months. The first was a bet on Manchester City to beat Everton, which ended in a draw. The second was when John placed a £200 bet on Arsenal to beat Leicester City, but Leicester ended up winning the game.

Despite these two losses, John’s overall record over the past year is an impressive 92% success rate, meaning he has made a profit of £12,000. This is why John is now confident enough to increase his stakes and go for bigger wins.

So how can you start betting like John and begin making some serious profits? Here are three tips:

1) Only bet on home teams to win – This is the most important rule that John follows and it is what has helped him make so much money. By avoiding away teams, you reduce your chances of losing money and increase your chances of making a profit.

2) Keep your stakes low – Another key reason why John has been successful is because he keeps his stakes low. This means that even if he does have a few losing bets, his overall profits won’t be affected too much. You should always start out with small stakes and then increase them gradually as you become more confident in your selections.

3) Have patience – Lastly, remember that it’s important to have patience when betting on football matches. Don’t try and force things and always wait for the right opportunity before placing your bet. If you do this, then you will greatly improve your chances of making a profit in the long run.
