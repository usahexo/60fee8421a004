In a record-breaking event at the Viejas Casino Resort in Alpine, California, nun Sister Madonna Buder–better known as the "Iron Nun"–beats out a man stepping rope.

The 82-year-old from Spokane, Washington, crossed the finish line with a time of 7 minutes and 17 seconds, beating the previous record of 7 minutes and 55 seconds set by German athlete Karsten Warholm.

"It just goes to show that age really is just a number," said Buder after her win.

Buder began her athletic career at the ripe age of 36, when she decided to train for and run her first marathon. A year later, she completed her first ultramarathon and has been breaking records ever since. In addition to running marathons and ultramarathons, Buder has also competed in triathlons and Ironman competitions.

"Sister Madonna is an amazing lady who has shown that it's never too late to start living an active lifestyle," said race director Christine Schmitt. "She is an inspiration to all of us."
