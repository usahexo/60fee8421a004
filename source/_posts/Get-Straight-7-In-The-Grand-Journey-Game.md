Do you want to be a Grand Journey master? Just like in any game, there is a learning curve. Some people are born naturals and some have to work at it. But don’t worry, we’re here to help with a guide that will let you dominate the game in just 5 minutes a day.

Day 1: The Basics

Grand Journey is all about managing your resources and deploying them in the right places at the right time. Your goal is to conquer territory and build an empire. The first thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with the different types of resources and how they can be used.

Wood is used for buildings and units.
Bricks are used for buildings and defenses.
Iron is used for units and upgrades.
Food is used for units and healing injured units.

Gold is used to buy units and upgrades.
The next thing you need to know is how to manage your workers. Workers can be assigned to gather resources or build buildings/units. You can also pause the game so that you can give orders without having to wait for your turn. This comes in handy if you need to make a strategic decision or if something unexpected happens that requires your attention. Now that you know the basics, it’s time to move on to day 2.

Day 2: Territories And Conquest
In order to win the game, you need to conquer territory. This can be done by attacking another player’s territory or by taking over neutral territories. You can see how much territory you control on the map by looking at your color-coded borders. The more territory you control, the more resources you will get each turn. The way to conquer territory is by attacking with your units. To do this, select a unit then click on the opponent’s territory that you want to attack. If your unit has enough strength, it will conquer the territory and remain there until it’s destroyed or replaced by another unit. Don’t forget that you can also use your spells (if you have any) to help out during battles. So far so good? Then let’s move on to day 3 of our guide!
